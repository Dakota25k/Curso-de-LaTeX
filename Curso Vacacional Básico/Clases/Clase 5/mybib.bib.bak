  abstract  = {We study holomorphic foliations tangent to singular real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurfaces in compact complex manifolds of complex dimension two. We give some hypotheses to guarantee the existence of dicritical singularities of these objects. As consequence, we give some applications to holomorphic foliations tangent to real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurfaces with singularities in $$\mathbb {P}^2$$P2.},

  abstract      = {We consider a large class of one-dimensional maps arising from the contracting Lorenz attractors for three dimensional flows: the eigenvalues $λ2<λ1<0<λ3$ of the flow at the singularity satisfy $λ1+λ3<0$ (instead of $λ1+λ3>0$ as in the classical geometric Lorenz models). Such flows were studied by A. Rovella who showed that non-uniform expansiveness is a persistent form of behavior (positive Lebesgue measure sets of parameters). Using mainly expansiveness, we prove the existence of absolutely continuous measures invariant under these maps, and from this fact we are able to construct Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measures for the original flows that generate them.},
